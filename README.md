# ⚗️ Chemical Reaction Success Prediction — AI Powered Web App

This project is a simple, AI-powered web application that predicts the probability of a chemical reaction being successful based on key reaction parameters:

1. Temperature
2. pH level
3. Reactant concentration

The app leverages a trained Artificial Neural Network (ANN) built with TensorFlow & Keras, wrapped in a Flask backend, and presented through a modern, responsive frontend.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Dataset**: A CSV dataset `reactions.csv` of past chemical reaction results
2. **Training**: ANN model trained on Temperature, pH, Concentration → Success
3. **Input Scaling**: StandardScaler (scikit-learn) used to normalize inputs
4. **Web Interface**: Users enter parameters through HTML form
5. **Prediction**: Flask backend loads the trained `.keras` model, predicts result
6. **Output**: Success probability and result displayed on the web page

## 🧪 Sample Input Parameters (with validation):

| Parameter        | Range           |
| ---------------- | --------------- |
| Temperature (°C) | 0°C – 2000°C     |
| pH               | 0 – 14          |
| Concentration    | 0.01 – 10 mol/L |

---

## 🚧 Limitations

* Prototype-level project (for educational/demo use)
* No database — users & data stored in browser localStorage & CSV only
* Accuracy depends on dataset quality
* Not a production-level authentication system

## 💡 Why this project?

Chemical reactions are sensitive to various conditions and predicting success can save valuable time and resources in laboratory settings.

This project demonstrates:

* Practical application of AI/ML in chemistry
* Full-stack web app integrating Flask backend & ML model
* Real-time AI-based decision support
* How data science and web development can combine to build useful scientific tools
